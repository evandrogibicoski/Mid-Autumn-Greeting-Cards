	<string>About Mid-Autumn Festival

Falling on the 15th day of the 8th month according to the Chinese lunar calendar, the Mid-Autumn Festival is the second grandest festival in Greater China (after Chinese New Year). The day is also known as the Moon Festival, as at that time of the year the moon is at its roundest and brightest.

Mid-Autumn Festival is an inherited custom of moon sacrificial ceremonies. The ancient Chinese observed that the movement of the moon had a close relationship with changes of the seasons and agricultural production. Hence, to express their thanks to the moon and celebrate the harvest, they offered a sacrifice to the moon on autumn days.

This custom could be traced back to the Zhou Dynasty (1046 - 256 BC) and was more often practiced by the royal class on the Autumnal Equinox. At that time, the custom had no festival background at all. Later in the Sui (581 - 618 AD) and Tang (618 - 907 AD) dynasties, social prosperity inspired the custom of appreciating the moon on the moon sacrifice ceremony day among common people and the two merged.

The people expressed their faith more liberally than the royal class and so they did not strictly hold their activities on the Autumnal Equinox. So the 15th of the 8th lunar month, the closest full moon day to the Autumnal Equinox, turned out to be a better choice and was set as a fixed festival. This happened in the Tang Dynasty. By the time of the Northern Song Dynasty (960 - 1127 AD), Mid-Autumn Festival had already become a widely celebrated folk festival. 

There are many legends and stories related to this grand festival. The most well-known ones include Jade Rabbit Pounding Medicine, Chang Er Flying to the Moon, Wu Gang Chopping Laurel Tree, and Zhu Yuanzhang and the Moon Cake Uprising. 

On the festival day, family members gather to appreciate the bright full moon, eat mooncakes, and express strong yearnings toward family members and friends who live afar. In addition, there are some other customs like playing lanterns, and dragon and lion dances in some areas. 

The mooncake is the special food of Mid-Autumn Festival. Mooncakes come in various flavors according to the region. Mooncakes are round, symbolizing the reunion of a family, so it is easy to understand how the eating of moon cakes under the round moon can evoke longing for distant relatives and friends. Nowadays, people present mooncakes to relatives and friends to demonstrate that they wish them a long and happy life.

中秋節簡介

農曆八月十五是我國的傳統節日，中秋節與春節、端午節、清明並稱為中國漢族的四大傳統節日。據史籍記載，古代帝王有春天祭日、秋天祭月的禮制，而祭月的節期為農曆八月十五，時日恰逢三秋之半，故名“中秋節”；又因這個節日在秋季八月，故又稱“秋節”、“八月節”、“八月會”、“仲秋節”；又有祈求團圓的信仰和相關節俗活動，故亦稱“團圓節”、“女兒節”。因中秋節的主要活動都是圍繞“月”進行的，所以又俗稱“月節”、“月夕”、“追月節”、“玩月節”、“拜月節”；在唐朝，中秋節還被稱為“端正月”。關於中秋節的起源，大致有三種：起源於古代對月的崇拜、月下歌舞覓偶的習俗、古代秋報拜土地神的遺俗。


中秋由來

　　“中秋”一詞，最早見於《周禮》。根據我國古代曆法，農曆八月十五日，在一年秋季的八月中旬，故稱“中秋”。一年有四季，每季又分孟、仲、季三部分，因為秋中第二月叫仲秋，故中秋也稱為“仲秋節”。到魏晉時，有“諭尚書鎮牛淆，中秋夕與左右微服泛江”的記載。直到唐朝初年，中秋節才成為固定的節日。 《唐書·太宗記》記載有“八月十五中秋節”。中秋節的盛行始於宋朝，至明清時，已與元旦齊名，成為我國的主要節日之一。這也是我國僅次於春節的第二大傳統節日。

　　相傳古代齊國醜女無鹽，幼年時曾虔誠拜月，長大後，以優良品德入宮，但未被寵幸。某年八月十五賞月，天子在月光下見到她，覺得她美麗出眾，後立她為皇后，中秋拜月由此而來。月中嫦娥，以美貌著稱，故少女拜月，願“貌似嫦娥，面如皓月”。

　　隨著社會的不斷發展，古人給予月亮許多傳說，從月中蟾蜍到玉兔搗藥，從吳剛伐桂到嫦娥奔月，豐富的想像力為月宮世界描繪了一幅幅斑駁陸離的勝景。自漢至唐，騷人墨客紛紛吟詠月亮及月中之事，八月十五月圓時成為抒發感情的極佳時刻。至北宋太宗年間，官家正式定八月十五日為中秋節，取意於三秋之正中，屆時萬民同慶。中秋之夜，明月當空，清輝灑滿大地，人們把月圓當作團圓的象徵，把八月十五作為親人團聚的日子，因此，中秋節又被稱為“團圓節”。

　　中秋節成為一年之中的重大節日，又與科舉考試有著極其微妙的關係，在我國封建社會，開科取士，一直是統治者十分重視的一件大事。而三年一次的秋闈大比，恰好安排在八月裡舉行。勝景與激情結合在一起，人們便將應試高中者，譽為月中折桂之人。每到中秋，必須進行隆重慶賀，成為全社會人民的重要風俗，經朝歷代，盛行不衰，中秋節逐漸成為我國四大節日（春節、清明、端午、中秋）之一。

	<string>Zhu Yuanzhang and Moon Cake Uprising

The custom of eating moon cakes on Mid-Autumn Festival is said to have begun towards the end of Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). At that time，the general populace, faced with the cruel governors, rose up against the Yuan Government in succession. Under such circumstances, Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the later Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), set out to organize an uprising by uniting various resistance forces. However, due to the oppressive presence of government officials (who conducted frequent searches of people and property), it was extremely hard to send messages between the resistance units.

One day, Zhu&apos;s military counselor, Liu Bowen, came upon an idea, and ordered his subordinates to hide paper slips with &quot;Uprising on August 15&quot; on them in mooncakes. Then, the mooncakes were distributed among insurrectionary armies in different places, asking them to support the uprising on the night of August 15. When the day came, all insurrectionary armies converged to participate in the uprising. Soon, Da Du (present-day Beijing), capital of the Yuan Dynasty, was captured.

When news came of the successful uprising, Zhu Yuanzhang was so delighted that he allowed his men to celebrate the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival with the common people and ordered the mooncakes used for hiding the paper slips to be distributed among the folks. Since then,  mooncakes have been made in more exquisite flavors, and the custom of eating mooncakes continues to this day.

	<string>朱元璋與月餅起義

秋節吃月餅相傳始於元代。當時，中原廣大人民不堪忍受元朝統治階級的殘酷統治，紛紛起義抗元。朱元璋聯合各路反抗力量準備起義。但朝庭官兵搜查的十分嚴密，傳遞消息十分困難。軍師劉伯溫便想出一計策，命令屬下把藏有“八月十五夜起義”的紙條藏入餅子裡面，再派人分頭傳送到各地起義軍中，通知他們在八月十五日晚上起義響應。到了起義的那天，各路義軍一齊響應，起義軍如星火燎原。

很快，徐達就攻下元大都，起義成功了。消息傳來，朱元璋高興得連忙傳下口諭，在即將來臨的中秋節，讓全體將士與民同樂，並將當年起兵時以秘密傳遞信息的“月餅”，作為節令糕點賞賜群臣。此後，“月餅”製作越發精細，品種更多，大者如圓盤，成為饋贈的佳品。以後中秋節吃月餅的習俗便在民間流傳開來。

	<string>Chang Er Flying to the Moon

As indicated by the most generally spread Mid-Autumn Festival story, in old times, there were ten suns sparkling in the sky. The heat was scorching and people suffered tremendously. There was a bowman named Hou Yi, who was resolved to mitigate this torment. He climbed up to the summit of Kunlun Mountain, took aim and with all his might, shot down nine of the suns. He said to the last sun in the sky: &quot;Starting now and into the foreseeable future, you should ascend on schedule and fall on time each day, and bring benefits to people!&quot; 

From that point on, everybody looked up to him. Numerous individuals became supporters of him and gained from him. A man named Fengmeng who was traitorous was among them. 

At some point, Wangmu (the Queen of Heaven) who lived in the Kunlun Mountain gave Hou Yi a potion as his reward. This potion could help individuals who ate it rise to paradise and become immortal. Notwithstanding, Hou Yi was not ready to disregard his significant other Chang Er on the earth, so he asked Chang Er to safeguard it. 

Chang Er, Hou Yi&apos;s significant other, was a delightful and kind lady who helped poor people, and people appreciated her. The eager Fengmeng really desired the potion. On the morning of a fifteenth day of an eighth lunar month, Fengmeng broke into Chang Er&apos;s home when Hou Yi was outside hunting. He compelled her to hand over the solution. Realizing that she was unable to overcome him, Chang Er gulped the solution right away. After she gulped the potion, she flew towards the moon. 

Hou Yi returned home and discovered his significant other vanished. He chased restlessly, while Chang Er remained close to a shrub tree on the moon and gazing back lovingly. &quot;Chang Er! Chang Er!&quot; He shouted and yelled urgently toward the moon. Yet, when he pursued forward, the moon returned, so he would never get up to speed. Missing his wife dearly, Hou Yi arranged a moon feast on each fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, anticipating to meet and rejoin Chang Er. 

Local folks missed the great hearted Chang Er dearly, too. They did likewise and put on a sacrifice on that day. From that point forward, the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, which was the day Chang Er traveled to the moon and separated with her husband, has become the Mid-Autumn Festival for people to reunite.

	<string>嫦娥奔月

遠古的時候，天上有十個太陽，曬得大地冒煙，海水乾枯，老百姓苦得活不下去。
　　有個叫羿的英雄力大無比，他用寶弓神箭，射下九個太陽。最後那個太陽一看大勢不妙，連忙認罪求饒，后羿才息怒收弓，命令這個太陽今後按時起落，好好兒為老百姓造福。
　　后羿的妻子名叫嫦娥，美麗賢慧，心地善良，大家都非常喜歡她。
　　一個老道人十分欽佩羿的神力和為人，贈他一包長生不老藥，吃了可以升天，長生不老。羿捨不得心愛的妻子和鄉親，不願自己一人升天，就把長生不老藥交給嫦娥收藏起來。
　　后羿有個徒弟叫蓬蒙，是個奸詐小人，一心想偷吃羿的長生不老藥，好自己升天成仙。
　　這一年的八月十五，羿帶著徒弟們出門打獵去了。天近傍晚，找藉口未去打獵的蓬蒙闖進嫦娥的住所，威逼嫦娥交出可以升天的長生不老藥。
　　嫦娥迫不得已，倉促間把藥全部吞下肚裡。馬上，她便身輕如燕，飄出窗口，直上雲霄。由於嫦娥深愛自己的丈夫，最後她就在離地球最近的月亮上停了下來。
　　聽到消息，羿心如刀絞，拼命朝月亮追去。可是，他進月亮也進，他退月亮也退，永遠也追不上。羿思念嫦娥，只能望著月亮出神。此時月亮也格外圓格外亮，就像心愛的妻子在望著自己。
　　第二年八月十五晚上，嫦娥走出月宮，默默地遙望下界，思念丈夫和鄉親們。她那美麗的面孔，使得月亮也變得格外圓格外亮。
　　后羿和鄉親們都在月光下祭月，寄託對嫦娥的思念。從此年年如此，代代相傳。由於八月十五正值中秋，就定為中秋節。
